### Whisper in Darkness



It was a rainy midnight. I was driving on a deserted road, heading home after a long day at work. I felt tired and bored, but I had no choice but to keep driving. The radio was broken, and the only sound I could hear was the rain hitting the windshield.

I tried to stay awake by humming a tune, but it didn't help much. I wished I had someone to talk to, or at least some music to listen to. I felt lonely and isolated, as if I was the only living being in the world.

Suddenly, I heard a whisper in my ear. It was faint and indistinct, but it sounded like a human voice. I jerked my head to the side, but there was no one there. I looked at the rearview mirror, but there was nothing behind me. I felt a chill run down my spine, and I wondered if I was hallucinating.

I shook my head and tried to ignore the whisper. I told myself that it was just my imagination, or maybe the wind. I focused on the road ahead, hoping to reach my destination soon.

But the whisper didn't stop. It grew louder and clearer, and it seemed to come from both sides of my head. I couldn't make out the words, but I felt a sense of dread and malice from the voice. It was as if someone was trying to torment me, or drive me insane.

I clenched my teeth and pressed the gas pedal, hoping to outrun the whisper. I didn't care about the speed limit or the traffic rules. I just wanted to get away from the voice that was haunting me.

But the whisper followed me. It became more and more persistent, and it started to say things that I couldn't understand. It sounded like a foreign language, or maybe a code. I heard words like "Cthulhu", "Nyarlathotep", "Azathoth", and "Yog-Sothoth". I had no idea what they meant, but they filled me with terror and disgust.

I felt a sudden pain in my head, as if something was trying to break into my mind. I screamed and swerved the car, losing control of the wheel. I saw a flash of light, and then everything went black.

I woke up in a hospital bed, surrounded by doctors and nurses. They told me that I had a car accident, and that I was lucky to be alive. They said that they found me unconscious on the road, with no signs of any other vehicle or person nearby. They said that they couldn't explain how I got the strange symbols carved on my forehead, or why I kept muttering the same words over and over again.

They said that they were going to run some tests on me, and that they hoped to find a cure for my condition. They said that they were sorry for what happened to me, and that they would do their best to help me.

But I knew that they were lying. I knew that they couldn't help me. I knew that it was too late for me.

I knew that the whisper was still there, inside my head. And I knew that it would never leave me alone.

I went to the bathroom, hoping to wash away the everything. I turned on the faucet and splashed some water on his face. I felt refreshed and calm, I had nothing to worry about.

But there is face shown in the mirror,  barely human, twisted and deformed by unspeakable horrors. It had no eyes, no nose, only a mouth with whisper.

My name is Adam Whisper.
